			I'm an aspiring web developer and currently enrolled in a part-time coding bootcamp starting April 2017. Currently, I am a senior customer support representative with a demonstrated history of efficiency in the workplace and sensitivity towards prioritizing my tasks based on business needs. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I am looking for an entry-level tech position that will complement my education while in coding school and soon-to-be new career field. 
			I have some experience working in quality assurance as a smoke tester using tools such as Confluence and JIRA. Work environment and culture is very important to me, along with involving myself in meaningful work where I can grow personally and professionally. Coworkers would describe me as knowledgable and engaged. I know myself to be very independent, dependable, and ready for a challenge. I am always looking for new opportunities that will enhance my path into the tech field so please connect with me!
